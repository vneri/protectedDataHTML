# protectedDataHTML
Send secrets with a self-decrypting HTML file

## Why
Do you ever have to send a sensitive information to someone and don't trust online encryption services or you are too lazy to ZIP a text file?

## How
- Just open the protectedData.html in your browser, replace the text in the field with whatever you want to encrypt, choose a password and then encrypt.
- Then click on "download file". Save the file and send it to the person
- Send them the password via a secure, different channel
- They can decrypt it
